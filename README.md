##  Description of the Paper

The paper explores how to make LLMs not only accurate but also efficient in their reasoning. It presents a structured taxonomy of methods to reduce unnecessary reasoning steps without compromising correctness, grouped into three categories:
- Model-Based Efficiency
- Output-Based Efficiency
- Prompt-Based Efficiency

It also discusses evaluation techniques, model compression, and practical applications of efficient reasoning in real-world domains like healthcare and autonomous systems.

##  Key Contributions and Insights

- Identified and organized 3 core strategies for improving reasoning efficiency in LLMs.
- Analyzed advanced CoT variants such as Tree-of-Thought and Graph-of-Thought.
- Summarized RL-based and fine-tuning approaches for model-level optimization.
- Demonstrated how prompting and routing strategies can optimize inference dynamically.
- Reflected on implications for small model deployment, data efficiency, and agentic AI.
