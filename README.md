## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, but often at the cost of efficiency, with verbose outputs and increased latency. This survey explores how to reduce unnecessary reasoning steps without sacrificing performance. The study is structured around three key strategies:

- **Model-Based Efficiency**
- **Reasoning Output-Based Efficiency**
- **Input Prompt-Based Efficiency**

---

## 1. Model-Based Efficiency

### 1.1 Reinforcement Learning with Length-Aware Rewards
Incorporates reward functions that penalize excessive reasoning steps while maintaining accuracy. Examples: OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ-32B.

### 1.2 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
Fine-tunes models using variable-length Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets:
- Post-Reasoning Compression (e.g., TokenSkip, C3oT)
- During-Reasoning Compression (e.g., Token-Budget, BoN Sampling)

### 1.3 Progressive Fine-Tuning
Gradually shortens reasoning steps during training (e.g., CoT-Valve).

### 1.4 Model Merging
Combines models with different reasoning behaviors to create efficient hybrids (e.g., Kimi k1.5).

---

## 2. Reasoning Output-Based Efficiency

### 2.1 Latent Reasoning Representations
Reasoning is compressed into model internals instead of explicit steps:
- Continuous thought tokens (Coconut)
- Distilled CoT tokens (CCOT, CODI)
- Auxiliary modules (SoftCoT)

### 2.2 Dynamic Inference Strategies
Smarter decoding and adaptive computation:
- Beam Search, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Certainty-based stopping (Dynasor-CoT, Certaindex)
- Summarization-based methods (LightThinker, InftyThink)

---

## 3. Input Prompt-Based Efficiency

### 3.1 Prompt-Guided Efficiency
Designs prompts to guide concise reasoning:
- Token-Budget prompts
- Chain-of-Draft (CoD)
- CCoT and MARP strategies

### 3.2 Attribute-Driven Routing
Routes queries to the most suitable reasoning strategy:
- RouteLLM, Claude Sonnet, Self-Ref, Sketch-of-Thought (SoT)

---

## 4. Data and Model Compression

### 4.1 Efficient Training Data
Use fewer, higher-quality examples to train reasoning:
- LIMO, s1K, SÂ²R show high performance with minimal data.

### 4.2 Small Model Optimization
Improve reasoning in small models via:
- Distillation (CoT + PoT)
- Compression (quantization, LoRA)

---

## 5. Evaluation & Benchmarks

Includes:
- Sys2Bench, Bag of Tricks, S1-Bench for task-specific reasoning evaluation.
- Overthinking detection frameworks to avoid redundant logic.
- QuantRM and CompressionReasoning for measuring compression effects.

---

## 6. Applications

Efficient reasoning techniques enable practical use of LLMs in:
- **Autonomous Driving**: Real-time decision-making from sensor fusion.
- **Embodied AI**: Human-like reasoning in robotics.
- **Healthcare**: Faster and more explainable diagnostics.
- **Recommender Systems**: Transparent, token-efficient personalization.

---

## 7. Discussion and Future Directions

Topics include:
- Hybrid SFT and RL training strategies.
- Meta-reasoners and task decomposition frameworks.
- Safety-efficiency tradeoffs and agentic AI architectures.

---

## Conclusion

Efficient reasoning is a critical step forward for scalable, responsible, and cost-effective deployment of LLMs across industries. This work provides a comprehensive taxonomy and opens new directions for research and real-world impact.
